Bibek Kabi currently working as a research engineer in TechViz (a virtual reality company based in Paris) received his PhD from Ecole Polytechnique, CNRS, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, prepared under the supervision of Prof. Eric Goubault and Prof. Sylvie Putot at Computer Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique (LIX) 91128 Palaiseau, France. During his PhD he was also supervised by Prof. Antoine Miné from Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. His thesis is dedicated to the study of combining abstract interpretation (mostly zonotopic) and constraint programming for synthesizing invariants. His PhD thesis can be downloaded through the link https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02925914/. He received his MS (by research) degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. His research interests include program verification based on zonotope abstraction, floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic, optimization of fixed-point formats in numerical programs, numerical linear algebra, data science and machine learning.
