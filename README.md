I'm currently working as a research engineer in TechViz (a virtual reality company based in Paris). I received my PhD from Ecole Polytechnique, CNRS, Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My PhD supervisors were Prof. Eric Goubault and Prof. Sylvie Putot from Computer Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique (LIX) 91128 Palaiseau, France. I was also supervised by Prof. Antoine Miné from Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. My thesis is dedicated to the study of combining abstract interpretation (mostly zonotopic) and constraint programming for synthesizing invariants. My PhD thesis can be downloaded through the link https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02925914/. I received my MS (by research) degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My research interests include program verification based on zonotope abstraction, floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic, optimization of fixed-point formats in numerical programs, numerical linear algebra, data science and machine learning.
